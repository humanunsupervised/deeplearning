    "Some things that you may need to think about include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dimensionality of the images that you may be working with. (e.g. N x H x W X C)\n",
    "- Expressing image data as tensors\n",
    "- Other pre-processing tasks such as cropping etc\n",

    "\n",
    "We are trying to express or represent invariances in the data. We normalise our data so that we can **speed up learning** about these invariances\n",

    "Mean normalisation is\n",

    "- Subtracting the **mean** from each image\n",
    "- then dividing by the **standard deviation**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Re-scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "We apply another type of normalization to 0-1 just for the purposes of plotting the image.  If we didn't do this, the range of our values would be somewhere between -1 and 1, and matplotlib would not be able to interpret the entire range of values.  By rescaling our -1 to 1 valued images to 0-1, we can visualize it better.\n",
